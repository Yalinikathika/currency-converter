# currency-converter
converting the currency value of one country to another
DESCRIPTION:
Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.

Currency converter mini project is built keeping this thing in mind. It is simply a calculator-like app developed using Ajax, Java servlets web features. In this application, there is regular update about currency of every country by which it displays present currency market value and conversion rate.

Such application can be used by any user, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis.

In this currency converter app, users are provided with an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter amount to be converted (say currency in Dollars), and display the converted amount (say currency in Euro)
USAGE:
First I have created the main div and placed two select sections for currency using HTML. Two select sections for form and to the field, that will helps you to choose the currencies. I have placed a lot of options and put their currency’s shortcode in the values. And also there I have placed a button for switching with an icon and there a field for showing the exchange rate of your selecting country.

Now using CSS I have placed all the elements in the right place, as you can see in the preview. There I have put the icon in the exchange button with the help of font-awesome library. For the down arrow button, I have placed an SVG shape as background image, you can style this program according your choice. Also, I have done other basic styling with CSS like margin, padding, font, color, etc.
